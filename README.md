# Employee-tracker

## Description
My motivation for this project was to make it easier for company to add departments, roles, and employees to their database. I built this project to grow my knowledge in sql and inquirer when both are working together.
This project will solve how long it takes to add a department, role, employee, and update an employees role.

## Insatallation 
You will need to have some type of database like vs code or git bash to see my code. when you open my code you will need to npm install first then npm start to be able to interact with it.

## Usage
The project only needs you to use the up and down arrows, enter, when selecting what you would like to do. when you choose an option you will then be shown questions to answer.

## Credits
My tutor, instructors and refrencing other code helped me complete parts when needed.
